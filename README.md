// Initial features
// A list of of users
// the ability to create users 
// the ability to delete users

// Principles CRUD 

// APP.js => UserList.js => User.js 

// state management

// Details page which we will need to share the state between it and the UserList.js
// based off the previous info we will store our users within a context


// everything starts via an action (user click / interaction, fetching new info )
// then through the action we call a reducer 
// then the reducer decides what needs to be done based on the action.type
// then a new state is generated
